          text: "The user wants a travel plan for Los Angeles for 2 travelers from April 18th, 2025 to April 25th, 2025 (8 days, 7 nights).\nThe budget is moderate.\nThe response should be a JSON object containing:\n1.  `hotelOptions`: A list of hotel options with name, description, geoCoordinates, address, image URL, price (moderate range), and rating.\n2.  `itinerary`: A list of daily itineraries, each including day number, date, theme, and a `dailyPlan` list. Each item in `dailyPlan` should have place name, details, image URL, price (indicating if free or estimated cost), geoCoordinates, rating, ticket requirement (boolean), best time to visit, and estimated time to complete the activity.\n3.  `travelPlan`: Overall trip duration and useful notes.\n\n**Constraint Checklist & Confidence Score:**\n\n1.  Generate travel plan for Los Angeles: Yes\n2.  Dates: 18 April 2025 - 25 April 2025: Yes\n3.  Travelers: 2: Yes\n4.  Budget: Moderate: Yes (Need to select hotels and activities reflecting this)\n5.  Return hotel options list: Yes\n6.  Hotel details: Name, description, geoCoordinates, address, image, price, rating: Yes\n7.  Suggest itinerary for each day: Yes\n8.  Itinerary details: Place name, details, image, price, geoCoordinates, rating, ticket needed, best time, time to complete: Yes\n9.  Include overall travel plan: Yes\n10. Overall plan details: Duration, notes: Yes\n11. Return response in specified JSON format: Yes\n\nConfidence Score: 5/5\n\n**Mental Sandbox:**\n\n*   **Hotel Selection:** Need to find 3-4 star hotels in central/convenient locations (e.g., Hollywood, West Hollywood, Santa Monica, Downtown LA) that generally fall within a moderate price range (e.g., $150-$300/night, but this can vary significantly). I'll look for hotels with good ratings (4+ stars). I need placeholder images and realistic price estimates. GeoCoordinates need to be accurate.\n*   **Itinerary Planning:** 8 days is a good amount of time to cover major LA highlights without being too rushed. I'll structure the days thematically (e.g., Hollywood Glamour, Beach Day, Arts & Culture, Theme Park Fun). I need to mix free activities (Walk of Fame, Santa Monica Pier, Griffith Observatory grounds) with paid ones (studio tour, museums, theme park) to fit the moderate budget. I'll need to find images, estimate prices (or state if free), get coordinates, ratings, ticket info, best times, and duration estimates for each activity.\n*   **Logistics:** Need to consider travel time between locations in LA – it's notoriously spread out. Grouping activities geographically each day makes sense. Suggesting public transport or ride-sharing apps fits a moderate budget better than renting a car and paying for parking everywhere, although a car offers flexibility. I'll add notes about transportation.\n*   **Dates:** April 18th (Friday) to April 25th (Friday), 2025. This means the trip includes two weekends. Weather in April is usually pleasant.\n*   **Data Fetching:** I will need to simulate fetching data like hotel details, prices, place details, images, coordinates, ratings, etc. I will use placeholder images and realistic but not live prices/ratings.\n*   **JSON Structure:** I must strictly adhere to the specified JSON format, ensuring all keys and nested structures are correct. Boolean values for `tickets` should be `true` or `false`.\n\n**Key Considerations for Moderate Budget:**\n\n*   Mix free activities (beaches, parks, window shopping, Griffith Observatory exterior) with selectively chosen paid attractions.\n*   Prioritize one major theme park or studio tour, not necessarily both, unless budget allows.\n*   Suggest dining options that range from food trucks/casual eateries to mid-range restaurants. (Though dining isn't explicitly requested in the output, it influences the budget).\n*   Hotel choice is crucial – aim for good value, possibly slightly outside the most prime locations but with good transport links.\n*   Suggest using public transport (Metro) or ride-sharing over renting a car + parking fees.\n\n**Drafting Plan:**\n\n*   **Day 1 (Fri, Apr 18):** Arrival & Hollywood Exploration (Walk of Fame, Chinese Theatre, Griffith Observatory for sunset/evening views).\n*   **Day 2 (Sat, Apr 19):** Movie Magic (Studio Tour - e.g., Warner Bros. or Universal Studios Hollywood - pick one based on budget/interest). If Universal, it covers the theme park aspect. If WB, maybe add Hollywood Museum or evening comedy show.\n*   **Day 3 (Sun, Apr 20):** Beach Bliss (Santa Monica Pier & Beach, Venice Beach Boardwalk & Canals).\n*   **Day 4 (Mon, Apr 21):** Arts & Culture (Getty Center - free entry, pay for parking, LACMA/La Brea Tar Pits).\n*   **Day 5 (Tue, Apr 22):** Downtown LA & History (Grand Central Market, Bradbury Building, Walt Disney Concert Hall exterior, The Broad - free ticket reservation needed, Olvera Street).\n*   **Day 6 (Wed, Apr 23):** Upscale & Views (Rodeo Drive window shopping, Beverly Hills exploration, maybe hike Runyon Canyon or visit Getty Villa - requires timed entry ticket).\n*   **Day 7 (Thu, Apr 24):** Flexible Day / Theme Park (Option: Disneyland/California Adventure - higher cost, needs full day, or revisit a favorite area, shopping, different museum like Petersen Automotive). Let's default to Petersen and Miracle Mile exploration for a moderate budget focus.\n*   **Day 8 (Fri, Apr 25):** Last Bites & Departure (Leisurely breakfast/brunch, last-minute souvenir shopping, depart from LAX).\n\n**Refining Activities:**\n\n*   Need specific details, images (placeholders), coordinates, ratings, etc., for each place.\n*   Estimate prices: Studio Tour (~$70-120), Universal (~$110-150+), Getty Center (Free entry, ~$20 parking), LACMA (~$25), The Broad (Free, reservation needed), Petersen (~$20).\n*   Estimate times: Walk of Fame (2-3 hrs), Studio Tour (3-4 hrs), Universal (Full day), Getty Center (3-5 hrs), Santa Monica/Venice (4-6 hrs).\n*   Best times: Griffith Observatory (Late Afternoon/Sunset), Beaches (Daytime), Museums (Daytime), Walk of Fame (Daytime).\n\nOkay, planning complete. I will now generate the JSON output based on these decisions. I will use placeholder image URLs and representative data for prices and ratings.",
